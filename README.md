Introduction
---------
MCScanX is a multi-alignment tool for a set of genomes to be compared and analyzed. This is a project introduced to me by Dr. Won Yim a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno. Arabidopsis Thaliana will be compared and anlayzed against itself and A. Lyrata. This repository will go more in-depth in the process of things.
